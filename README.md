JavaScript Final Exercise.
For the assessment of the second module (JavaScript) of the Full-Stack Edit course, we had to create specific functions for the website we built for the previous HTML and CSS module assessment.

-Loading implementation;

-API fetching;

-Dynamic date;

-Newsletter submission;

...

CONCLUSION after the evaluation of the final exercise:
At the time of completing this exercise, I felt that I still needed to practice my skills and logic in constructing various functions. However, with the knowledge I had at that moment, I was able to achieve most of the objectives required for this final project.
